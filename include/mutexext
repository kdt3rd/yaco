/// @brief Inverse of std::lock_guard
///
/// There are some patterns where you want to have a lock
/// while some work is set up, unlock to perform the (slow) task,
/// then re-lock to record said task. That can be accomplished
/// with the traditional lock_guard, but this can reduce the manual 
/// scope blocks having to be inserted into the code.
/// Used just as you would lock_guard, except it unlocks at initialization
/// and then re-locks at destruction time.
